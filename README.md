# Pointer

Pointer is a browser-based, self-hosted, fully open source mini Markdown notebook, written in Rust and TypeScript.

Users can create new or import local Markdown files. One file can be edited by one user or by multiple users in real time when it's in a shared state.

Inspired by Gist and Jupyter Notebook, users can edit, compile, and run inline code snippets written in multiple programming languages in the note.
